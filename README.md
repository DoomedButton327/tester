## 🔄 GitHub Sync

The league can auto-save all data and match screenshots directly to your repo via the GitHub API.

### Setup
1. Go to **Admin → GitHub Sync**
2. Enter your GitHub username, repo name, and branch
3. Create a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `repo` scope
4. Paste it in and click **Save & Connect**

Once connected:
- Every result, player change, or fixture update is committed automatically to `data/league-data.json`
- Match screenshots are uploaded to `match-images/` in your repo
- On next page load, the app reloads data from GitHub so it's always in sync

### Token Security
Your token is stored in your browser's `localStorage` only — it is never sent anywhere except directly to `api.github.com`. For a public repo with one admin, this is the standard approach.

> ⚠️ Don't share your screen while the Admin panel is open, as the token is visible in the form.
